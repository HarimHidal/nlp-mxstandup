how are they?
I am Alex Fernández I have stopped seeing
I have stopped watching the news, I no longer believe
in a program where the news is
a journalist finance an economist
but the weather a nalgona
as there is no fart there
no wonder they never hit it, you go out there
in shorts like that to every mother and not true raining
Yes, ruby ​​looked very prepared, shit
ready but who knows why not
because they put a little dress on them like that
like a meter of fabrics tight tight
tight like when you pack meatballs
to the void like this
poor can't breathe or move
squeaks when moved
a preparation in phenomena
enviable enviable weather
as we can see up here in the
cancun peninsula
here is a sea
here some arrows I don't know what they are
let's go with you Carlos
nothing, nothing really, or already like 80 percent
woman 20 percent map
by heavens okay mothers could change the
map of mexico for one of the treasure and
no one realizes
poor because apart from being all the
climate of the whole country there is the
poor and good as we can see in the
state of mexico in the maximum will be 25
to 23 at the maximum because we think of
the maximum will be 24 to the minimum 23
nothing will happen in the city of moroleón
here and suddenly ok chiapas
because we have to go there, let's go
we go
because it has to move
and there is no is Chiapas I do not know where
you were is where is chiapas from
someone knows about sports does not know
where is it in chiapas hand let's go with you
Carlos equal to nothing
because it even gets in the way, I don't know, it's so much
woman who is already for herself well
hurricane ramiro will be downgraded to
3 once I touch my chichi
then the news is the worst because
they are not only relevant news anymore
they mix sad news with news
happy as well as sad happy sad sad happy
a panda is born a panda is born
I mean we take them seriously all
wife horrible news they kill a
a lot of people in tamaulipas return
of the note
and this gentleman still gives his opinion of
a real shame what happens in
tampico
to know what is the worst
that nobody does anything
in other news the Milanese cake
biggest in the world
but starting from Mexico City
let's go with my partner joaquín who has
all the information up to Carlos
after what is the lettuce of the
world's largest Milanese cake
as you can see it is green and crisp
on this side
very happy to be with all the
information because they always bring all the
information
in the middle sorry
we're here on the lettuce side, let's go
over there the tomato with me
partner karla iberia sanchez who is
interviewing people carla many
thank you thank you very much we are here
interviewing people very happy
everyone here with the Milanese cake more
great in the world people are very
effusively cooperating very much madam
Lupita, how is she?
happy lady lupita happy
very happy very happy really
Pontes is the biggest Milanese cake
of the world, how good that the government
bring these things
I say nothing else we lack the light and the
water but we already have to cake
loving ready there is always the girl and her
little girl, how is it okay?
if i didn't go to school
and I love it when they don't know what to wear
This girl
everyone is here on the cake
largest Milanese in the world for real
even ruby ​​the girl from the
weather how is it
who likes band music here
raise your hand that you like music
band ok ok I see some hands and the
others who listen when they drink
and don't come with me after two
loggerhead there is nothing I enjoy more
what beethoven
there is no reason why that bitch reminds me
then she
we all fall with the band music is
a genre that we all end
ever listening there are not 8 vats that
do not hold in juliaón is really
scientifically proven
there are people who listen to one of two
songs there are people who take it as a
Lifestyle
but band music is a genre that
I love it because it has these vocalists
that I do not know what happens to them that they get stuck
at the end of the words
and I love you
he arrives at his house, what an old wave I'm going to sleep
and you don't understand anything that says nothing
of what they say they are not there
of course
and apart it seems that they are dancing
capoeira
looks like street fighter characters
before the fight
and they are doing nothing but channels
second because they are saying egg
I am a millionaire, I did not finish elementary school
you don't understand anything they say but
yes, all the sentences end with
a relative iron
and a sound that makes the tuba
because because the one with the tuba doesn't have
a lot of work
he had a difficult day and
they put it to finish the sentences of the
vocalist not with a sound like yeah
squeeze the tuba
gone crazy culiacán
iron relative
There are two kinds of music songs from
band are the mamalonas and the
romantic
the mamalonas the mamalonas are those of
chaos because the music of the bands
mexican hip hop
nothing more than in the video instead of
pour champagne one on her nalgona
They are
throwing buchanan's to the cousin of the
trumpeter orale
before carlita cheer up
nothing else and that it was bacardi is buchanan's
we are family
and then there are the romantic ones because nothing
more romantic than 24 motherfuckers dresses
equal
ten of them overweight
dancing romantically with their
instruments
They have this little spin when they
they get excited give it
and back the one with the tuba turns and grabs orbit
very different from the turns of the cumbia
not the cumbia and the sauce
sets are handled differently is
another ideology they don't do these
turns they have a little step as if
they were going to fall off the cliff but no
they fall like that
these things like the lawyer rodolfo
campa thing
that I am not deceived there is no
graduate
and the keyboardist, of course, I studied
accounting but i'm bored
the videos are wonderful not always
they have this woman who is worried
that she is grabbing a column like Juan
Gabriel
depends on the budget of the video can
be pretty or not
she is always very worried how to search
and they never find it because it measures how
120 so here it is chinga
but I have a problem with the music of
band one is just a little bit
misogynist there is a little bit of violence
against women there a little almost no
It shows but I tell the truth it is not noticeable and
we realize this because they are some
geniuses of composition
really really these gentlemen what
they do is that they put two verses very
pretty
then they are the drums to distract
and in the end the insult
and then nobody notices and stops
show them this he composed the song
and how I want you to love me and I
I will hug you to the golden chaparra
but there is something about you that always drives me away
that you are an asshole
Thank you!
