Thank you so much
what a fucking fart how are they so good
how good ladies and gentlemen I have
many existential fears
enough existential fears ladies and
Gentlemen a few days ago, go shit
to a public bathroom they will wonder what
has to do has everything to do
allow me a few seconds I went in to shit a
public toilet was not a public toilet like
any other these that have off
now and as a caveman using
ancient technology was a public toilet
with state-of-the-art technology had one of
these motion sensors that
detect when there is a living being inside
the bathroom light turns on
automatically and while
shitting the sensor went off
and honestly said event made me
doubt my own existence man I said
what the hell is going on don't stop
exist while I was shitting
shit then I exist I imagined
I imagine that is the adage applicable in
not this bathroom and if so, how horrible
that your first encounter with the
existence be seeing your shit there with
corn kernels in the cup no what
horrible but that's life life is
from the dick honestly this look
I usually shit a lot in public toilets.
I do all the time it's a hobby and it's
I like to do it there are no times that I go in
everyone is going to shit in public toilets
occupied only one free which is
the disabled bathroom and tell me
I'm going to give a taste why not
I deserve it, I have worked very hard
they won't let me lie we all shit
one of those fucking bathrooms is huge dude
bigger than bolivia that
shit
Bolivia no longer has an outlet to the sea
fucking bathroom if you have access to the sea
how big I'm shitting and saying
my living room fits here without farts, dude
wondering why they give them so much
What space can you use to have
plenty of room in the bathroom to stretch out
the legs sorry but
a lot of the people who come here to shit
He has no mobility in his legs.
who they want to cheat, I don't get to be
cruel just for being cruel
honestly ladies and gentlemen because
because deep down I'm scared is what
what's happening why why until
where I know I do not suffer from any
physical disability I'm shitting with
scared expecting that at any moment
someone came I cached there in the charade
not that someone comes and knocks on the door
and say someone is shitting right
make it a handicap with a gun
and say I hope whoever is shitting is
disabled
but
me and mr nine millimeters
we take care of making him disabled
I'm shitting with fear and I know that
That's wrong
ladies and gentlemen use things that
are reserved for other people
but I was shitting what could I do
honestly one is not really a
to be free one lives at the whims of his
own sphincter when the sphincter says
at this point in space-time it will
shit
yes sir at that point in space-time
he's going to shit like no and I know he's not there
good but a clear example where no
it's always so wrong to use things
reserved for other people if any
have ever entered an abortion clinic
you will realize that like any clinic
there is a waiting room like any room
wait there's a seat reserved for
who is reserved that seat for
pregnant women
I wonder how many geniuses I know
need to devise paradox so
ironic
which consists of placing a seat
reserved for pregnant women in a
place full of pregnant women
that they don't really want to be
pregnant
If I went in there, I would shamelessly take
seat I would say well I'm going to sit no
nothing happens if a woman comes
pregnant to ask me for the seat I would say
dude it's not like you worry a lot about you
pregnancy güey give me
also 30 minutes dude in 30 minutes now
she won't be pregnant don't be selfish
It bothers me a lot ladies and gentlemen one
legend printed on many packages
of groceries that says easy open look
I'm not an expert, but I
It seems that if you have two hands, dude
absolutely everything in this fucking life goes
to be easy open guy, what a life so
loose and easy the one we wear today
in day as a species ladies and gentlemen
in which the already very easy act of opening
bullshit we made it easier
still dude and boy are we lazy
shit that they go through life inventing
güey technology to satisfy the
needs of our own
laziness dude and arm rests
we seriously get tired of having arms
guy
there are people
who cannot afford to rest
your arms
because they don't have arms, dude
and we are demanding hedonists, dude
with our arms well accommodated
saying dude I didn't ask to be born with
so many limbs this is not my fault
guy
I am the victim who stops seeing me like this
no
the peeled nuggets, man, I can peel myself
my own nuggets stop selling me the
peeled you only feed my
laziness enough already
the concept of ladies straws and
Gentlemen what is the logic behind
a straw some spend a lot
creative in the past, someone said
has realized everything
