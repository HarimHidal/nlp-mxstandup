Thank you so much
what a fucking fart how are they so good
how good ladies and gentlemen I have
many existential fears
enough existential fears ladies and
Gentlemen a few days ago, go shit
to a public bathroom they will wonder what
has to do has everything to do
allow me a few seconds I went in to shit a
public toilet was not a public toilet like
any other these that have off
now and as a caveman using
ancient technology was a public toilet
with state-of-the-art technology had one of
these motion sensors that
detect when there is a living being inside
the bathroom light turns on
automatically and while
shitting the sensor went off
and honestly said event made me
doubt my own existence man I said
what the hell is going on don't stop
exist while I was shitting
shit then I exist I imagined
I imagine that is the adage applicable in
not this bathroom and if so, how horrible
that your first encounter with the
existence be seeing your shit there with
corn kernels in the cup no what
horrible but that's life life is
from the dick honestly this look
I usually shit a lot in public toilets.
I do all the time it's a hobby and it's
I like to do it there are no times that I go in
everyone is going to shit in public toilets
occupied only one free which is
the disabled bathroom and tell me
I'm going to give a taste why not
I deserve it, I have worked very hard
they won't let me lie we all shit
one of those fucking bathrooms is huge dude
bigger than bolivia that
shit
Bolivia no longer has an outlet to the sea
fucking bathroom if you have access to the sea
how big I'm shitting and saying
my living room fits here without farts, dude
wondering why they give them so much
What space can you use to have
plenty of room in the bathroom to stretch out
the legs sorry but
a lot of the people who come here to shit
He has no mobility in his legs.
who they want to cheat, I don't get to be
cruel just for being cruel
honestly ladies and gentlemen because
because deep down I'm scared is what
what's happening why why until
where I know I do not suffer from any
physical disability I'm shitting with
scared expecting that at any moment
someone came I cached there in the charade
not that someone comes and knocks on the door
and say someone is shitting right
make it a handicap with a gun
and say I hope whoever is shitting is
disabled
but
me and mr nine millimeters
we take care of making him disabled
I'm shitting with fear and I know that
That's wrong
ladies and gentlemen use things that
are reserved for other people
but I was shitting what could I do
honestly one is not really a
to be free one lives at the whims of his
own sphincter when the sphincter says
at this point in space-time it will
shit
yes sir at that point in space-time
he's going to shit like no and I know he's not there
good but a clear example where no
it's always so wrong to use things
reserved for other people if any
have ever entered an abortion clinic
you will realize that like any clinic
there is a waiting room like any room
wait there's a seat reserved for
who is reserved that seat for
pregnant women
I wonder how many geniuses I know
need to devise paradox so
ironic
which consists of placing a seat
reserved for pregnant women in a
place full of pregnant women
that they don't really want to be
pregnant
If I went in there, I would shamelessly take
seat I would say well I'm going to sit no
nothing happens if a woman comes
pregnant to ask me for the seat I would say
dude it's not like you worry a lot about you
pregnancy güey give me
also 30 minutes dude in 30 minutes now
she won't be pregnant don't be selfish
It bothers me a lot ladies and gentlemen one
legend printed on many packages
of groceries that says easy open look
I'm not an expert, but I
It seems that if you have two hands, dude
absolutely everything in this fucking life goes
to be easy open guy, what a life so
loose and easy the one we wear today
in day as a species ladies and gentlemen
in which the already very easy act of opening
bullshit we made it easier
still dude and boy are we lazy
shit that they go through life inventing
güey technology to satisfy the
needs of our own
laziness dude and arm rests
we seriously get tired of having arms
guy
there are people
who cannot afford to rest
your arms
because they don't have arms, dude
and we are demanding hedonists, dude
with our arms well accommodated
saying dude I didn't ask to be born with
so many limbs this is not my fault
guy
I am the victim who stops seeing me like this
no
the peeled nuggets, man, I can peel myself
my own nuggets stop selling me the
peeled you only feed my
laziness enough already
the concept of ladies straws and
Gentlemen what is the logic behind
a straw some spend a lot
creative in the past, someone said
has realized everything
the effort
what do we have to do to drink water
dude it's too much effort today I have to
bring my hand from the starting position
a second position b surround the glass
with my fingers raise the glass to
later take it to my mouth and
drink the liquid inside the
Same guy for when the liquid arrives
I'm going to be dehydrated to my mouth
I have to do something
This is a matter of life and death, man
What am I going to do? I'm going to invent a tunnel
made of plastic that carries liquid directly to
my muzzle because because I'm lazy
shit yes sir and I accept it no
some other lazy person passed the time or
even lazier and even more
creative that the previous said I will
enough of this shit having to
tilt my head forward to
take the straw with your lips, dude that
I'm going to make up a straw that
bend and come straight to my mouth
in order to make the slightest effort
possible guy
I am very bothered by the term open easy
as if really opening things were
very difficult dude would confer on a
greater degree of difficulty if
they ask me the opposite act of opening
what is the act of closing ladies and
gentlemen, how many times have you
after you leave your house you close the
door 20 minutes walk and you say
dick yes I closed the door of my house
when I left my house you come back
closing requires a certain degree of
memory retention guy
It has never happened to me in this mind, man
that I arrive at my house I open the door
twenty minutes later I'm sitting down
with my arms well accommodated
looking at the flower house or something in
Netflix
and suddenly I say cock if I opened the
door of my house to never enter me
it has happened is bullshit
let me tell you that if someone has
past you are an asshole is what you are
you need to dry off with a neurologist because
what is happening to him is not normal
fortunately or unfortunately ladies and
gentlemen I have two hours of material
scattered around and when one has two
hours of comedy material
finds himself in dire need of
start from scratch I don't know what cock of
I want to talk now and the more I think
What do I mean now more goes away
gearing a fucking question on me
head that won't let me sleep let me
give them a bit of context for
understand what question I mean
comedy central
ladies and gentlemen every year takes
held a comedy festival in the
mexico city called comedy central
fest is three days where there is comedy in
several places there in the city of
Mexico the last day a
party with all the comedians in a
bar called wok every fucking year
every fucking day of every fucking day
years there is never a chain worker outside
hollow except that fucking night and yeah
someone does not know what a chainsaw is a
cadenero is this guy who based
entirely in their racist conceptions
will decide if tonight you are going to
have fun or not you are going to have fun
decision is entirely in your hands
dude just when man thinks he is
the master of his own destiny arrive
the owners of the bars and they put this
human wall outside your
establishment that is who decides what
is what goes on with your life son of your
mother whore
all the comedians passed without
problem came one of the producers
of the festival channel to celebrate that already
the working day had ended on
cadenero because he let us pass some
because we were comedians the producer
obviously the chain man is not a comedian
did not let it pass the producer put
pretty asshole and he told him you don't know
who am I say dude is the question
more difficult of philosophy man what
you hope this poor guy answers you
devil guy
if I were that chain-worker, I would have
With that said, you know who you are, dude
I mean don't come
don't come to get me your farts friend and
come home hires a psychiatrist
until and if you want truth solve the
existential crisis you have and when
you have the answer, you are coming and I
I decide if you have fun or not tonight
but don't come and leave me all the work
the question to me is who you are, let's think
for a second on a person who doesn't
is we think for a second
in the sons of drug traffickers
when he is a child obviously he
drug dealer does not tell him look jo dad
He is dedicated to dissolving people in acid, right
he does not tell her that he invents some lie
how dad sells slang son if you
they ask at school tell them that dad
he sells slang the boy is a boy
children are idiots they buy the
lie goes through life very sure that
he's the son of a man who sells slang
but there comes a point in adolescence
in which the child has greater criteria and
he begins to question the whole style of
life that he has led for all his whore
life does not face his father and says dad
one moment man
because there is a pet tiger in it
garden guy this is not the lifestyle
of a man who sells slang
because mommy never gets old daddy watches
good guy
dad because we worship a saint who
church clearly does not recognize
thank you very much ladies and gentlemen
