a little bit because this always happens to me
detail when I enter the stage a lot
people identify a lot with me because
you think I'm people with a lot of money because of me
profile
then I clarify once that not that
not that I come from very poor families
poor of those poor but poor

It's more Maria Merce doesn't peel her
one of those poor that gives me courage to be
poor for example when you get angry with
someone from your family who comes first
what are you doing lock yourself in your room and
courage at the door I had
curtain what the fuck it was
I just did it like that and the fucking sheet flew off, dude

santa claus never came home never
the fucking fat asshole arrived hopefully the
global warming will melt the canton

santa claus and mom never came so
let's not be sad she made us
tamales to have something to unwrap

Salinas and Rocha credits and credits no
family credit we get money from
afore we sold the points of the
infonavit we were very steep
It is more those of Salinas and Rocha and no longer
They all exist, they charge me
as the fucking old woman was saved

very poor that we were others we were of
I had a large family in total 18
brothers we had mom in a room
aside so that dad wouldn't see her because
he always huercos and that guy not forgiven
in fact one day dad being the provider
I got sick from the family money
being the youngest of all the children I had
what to do with the family because
because we being poor we mature
from a very young age like this we
we slept wrapped in newspapers
like avocados and you know how to say
I was covered and the sun was giving me and I was
day I woke up I'm going to be graduated
mature and mature
I went to Monterrey in the center of the
city ​​changing making you want and
I was going, hey, give me a taco

that they believe me
I realized that the more
Fucked, they would see me, they gave me 10

well give me for the order
sometimes people came back and I
Okay, hey, give me a taco, hey

so bad of the other for me too
They are farts, one of them eases me
the other is a fart
who taught me to ask one day to go
to the city of Monterrey Nuevo León there
a guy in the center of the city that is
a famous and is an icon that guy put it
he's an icon because he asks you for money
on the street but he asks you convinced
that he wants it, that is, you go by and you get this guy

do not know the best do not know do not
worry a day going through there by the
downtown monterrey de la
