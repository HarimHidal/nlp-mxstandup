like this breed
thank you my name is franco escamilla
for those who do not know me much pleasure
before starting is an apology yes
I say something that offends them, it was unintentionally, I'm not from
here
i don't speak the language
and the DF scares you every time I come and
you hear every urban legend and they tell you
be careful in the df take your wallet
in the bag ahead
the cell phone in the eggs
me in my ass thinking who they are going to
talk they don't suck
and it occurred to me I said to a buttock
and a friend told me that from here he says
be careful because here the thieves are very
very unfortunate they just mess with
your money but with your head
they come up to you and ask you hey what
time is and you are not five because at 5
you were worth mother
then that way it stays with you
engraved life
then you're at home it's five o'clock and
you are afraid and you don't know why
I will never forget the first time it comes
the city fascinated because they sell here
quesadillas of everything
less cheese
the same and tell me sucker but I for myself a quesadilla
it's an omelette with cheese and it was fucked
and we were in the city and there is a lady
making the tortillas by hand, lady me
she makes three quesadillas and tells me what
and I'm still a sucker chicken asshole
that she gives them to me
man shut my nose with mother
and I said it's not okay, he fucked me, he fucked me
The quesadillas were delicious and she told me
I liked them like the fuck I didn't love them
the lady says what time it is and I said no
shit I already know
I tell you nothing else I am a native
from cuautla morelos there is a difference
between the city and morelos of accents nothing
more on the outside we are all the same but the
accent changes in the df they speak towards
up and we from Morelos
we speak down or in the df they speak
upwards
and in morelos down
but I'm 18 years old living in Monterrey
I am already naturalized from Monterrey.
I became old in Monterrey, I'm already 34 years old
it was worth mother, I already suffer from what I know
called generation gap for the conalep
I'm already old
I'm already out of the loop, dude, I'm already old
I already get along with my parents
I already lent them money is the blowjob
my dad occupied five thousand pesos and how
no, I will lend it to you and poor thing because
for five thousand pesos from my bitch three
weeks
He talks to him at dawn where my money is, asshole
if you buy a soda I have ah
for soda porn to pay my five
A thousand pesos
he told me how the children are and I
sad they don't have toys I don't have my
five thousand pesos
I already get along with my parents, my mother
a peculiarity does not let me smoke I have
34 years old and my mother won't let me smoke and
she smokes fucking hypocrite for real
and everything bad that happens to me
blame the cigarette he talks to me during
You tours and how was my son, I'm fine mommy
a little tired is the cigarette
how are the children all struggling
with the school is the cigarette
but they don't smoke
I get along well with dad, my dad is a
almost 60 year old man who hates
technology and technology hates him
the gift a cool smartphone and each
what sounds they get angry
what a fart what a fart what a fart
answer heck and tell me is that it moves
and I told him in good vibes bring a vibrator and me
put a punch in the bad muzzle
I don't use those devil mothers
and here you were born bastard that I don't know
forgot
Thank you
how cute
as soon as I became a comedian my
the first money the family earns
to dinner and I bought my dad my mom every
who a smartphone for
stay in touch with them and made the
stupidity of making an account of
facebook to each one if you have not done it
do not do it
when your parents ask you what it is
facebook tell him not that mother charge
they better not have because a mom with
facebook is a like machine
what you put guy
public fuck her mother everything and your mom like
I hate my parents and my mom we
we love you like
I'm going to take the fuck and mom is
the fucking cigar like
to what you put
and my dad, my dad, he takes pictures of everything
step a dog 8 photos
if the quick time on the tablet looks
how he walks in the fucking dog
and he already has the anger that he did not know
phone you tell me is that he does not take photos this
mother there I'm going to check it and she was the
memory full was all the fart and
I checked the memory for pure curiosity
He had like 1000 photos and 42 videos of his
ear
I better gave him a phone from those of de
commercial store I gave him a phone
that are worth 300 pesos and bring 500 of balance
the balance is worth more than the fucking phone
my dad is happy because he is a simple
don't hang up and call but he likes it
a lot of texting but he doesn't want to download the
whatsapp according to him they charge
and he sends me sms messages that stop
answer him I spend a peso
and he sends you the strangest messages because
he has not removed the autocomplete and not
check what he writes when typing is worth it
mother
and I do not send messages in
dad who says frank are you coming to the
moon with elephant
I better talk to him
daddy you grabbed my cigars
those are for sleeping
and he doesn't know how to lock his phone sometimes
he calls you inadvertently from the bag
pants or jacket you answer and their
keys
and
how he fights with other old men
I tell him, dad, hang up the balance, fucking
mother
and I say lock the phone and in good vibes I tell him
press the asterisk put another punch on my muzzle
with more respect, you bastard
but I understand it is another generation
neither did we understand my grandfather my grandfather
rest in peace was of the men of
before a Mexican male of which of the
that they hit the old woman, you see that before
yes you could
it's not my thing, check out the movies
of black and white and gold cinema
when the old woman came out and became a sucker, she would
a cachetón and shut up the snout
the morra did not say anything she was going to cry
I deserve a corner
now what the fuck can you hit your
old woman you get in trouble with the
police not with her
it is expected that you fall asleep and it puts you
a broomstick in the
fundillo and pray
she brings you clowns as a lollipop for two hours
Tells you who the fuck her mother and you, me, me
me
we men have become very slutty
you get home good chingón give me a beer
please
do not go to shit the beast
I'm starting to feel that too
disconnection with young people
with the guys I already say guys from there
you already screwed up
for example those who follow me on twitter
they know that I follow my followers
killed many those who are good
a fat woman and five bathrobes to hide
it is not true I follow more men than
women for two reasons the first my
old woman checks twitter every day
and the second the women tweet pure
bullshit
they tweet at 11 at night with 11
minutes 11 with 11 make a wish
and I answer them ask for a shitty brain
or if not on twitter the first day of the month
july surprise me
I answer you, you are fine, stupid surprise
that it already came back
a complicated month the month of July I have
to say that as a comedian he was quite a
adventure of the month of July one hopes that
pass something to be able to talk about it and
July was a month that gave us a lot of
what to talk about, not everything could, he ran away
Chapo and I are not going to make jokes of him
chapo not me
I'm not stupid
I'm not going to make fun of a boss who got away
John Sebastian died in peace
Rest the beckhams of the south of my
idols go to heaven
Guy fucked Maribel Guardia
He's the only bastard that ever made it to the
sky crashing her
even san pedro saw him arrive
thanks
